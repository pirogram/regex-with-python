  There is an inherent difficulty in explaining what regular expressions are. As is the case with many other subjects in software engineering, regular expressions are part of a different paradigm than what we are familiar with. That makes it hard to explain it in theory or to understand it in terms of pure concept. However, as soon as you see it, you not only understand it but also appreciate the ingenuity in its design and wide applicability it has in solving several classes of problems.

  So, rather than starting from the explanation of what regular expressions are or what they are good for, let's start from a problem that we want to solve and then arrive at the conclusion that we need regular expressions like tool to solve that problem.

  Based on this approach, here is the outline of our regex learning plan:

  * A short and sweet introduction to problem of defining patterns, searching for them in plain text, extracting the matching portions of the text etc.
  * A multi-topic study of regular expressions. Learning the language and mastering it with various practice problems.
  * Solving a couple of problems where our full knowledge of regex can be applied.
