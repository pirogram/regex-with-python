  Here is what we are going to do now. We are going to learn regular expressions one bit at a time. Here is the broad outline:

  * How to write patterns in regular expressions and use these patterns to `match` text. This is where you learn pretty much 80% of this language.
  * How to extract the text that matches the pattern. This is really a small bit once you have a pattern in hand.
  * How to replace the matching text with some other text. This is also a small bit once the language itself has been learnt.
