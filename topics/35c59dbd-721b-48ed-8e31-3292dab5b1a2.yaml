  ## Stage 1

  Let's talk about a problem that someone can actually run into. Let's say, you were interested in finding out the most popular websites that kids in your school go to. You create a Google Spreadsheet based Form and send a link to everyone in your school. There is only one simple question: `What's your favorite website?`.

  ## Stage 2

  Answers start pouring in and your Google spreadsheet starts filling in with the name of the websites. You are hoping that you can easily count the distinct names and that would tell you how popular different websites are.

  ## Stage 3

  While you were waiting for all the results to come in, you find that some people entered just the simple name (e.g. `google`), some others prefer to provide domain name (e.g. `google.com`). You were still wondering how you would handle that when (as they say) all hell broke loose.


  ## Stage 4, 5 and so on so forth

  You find that students are entering information in all sorts of format. Some are providing the domain names (`google.com`), some are providing the full url (`https://www.google.com`) and some are even providing links to specific sections of the website (`https://www.wattpad.com/tags/children`). How are you ever going to sort through all of this?
